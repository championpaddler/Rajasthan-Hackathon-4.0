PROJECT: 
We built an web application which is able to 
1. Symptom based appointment booking system for the tourists. It will also alert if the symptoms presented needs  emergency attention and an option to do video call with the doctor.  Symptom based appointment booking saves time as it, being acting as a virtual assistant to the doctor also allows speciality specific appointment booking. Hence saving time. 
2. Provide them with weather data such as temperature, windspeed, humidity, etc. It will also the features UV index and time that can be spent in sun without getting sunburnt based on the skin colour.
3. Telecommunication systems in Rajasthan isn't that great and sometimes a fellow traveller might find themselves lonely, so we created a forum(with an ML based spam filter) which will allow the tourists to ask specific queries and interact with fellow travellers.
4. Hotel Booking System
5. Monument Ticket Booking System 
6. Cab Booking system
  IT IS AWESOME BECAUSE :
1. No such dedicated platform is available with tourists' health in mind, and a lot of the foreign tourists avoids third world countries because of this. 
2. It integrates everything one will need to travel to a place  and hence avoiding the hassle of  downloading multiple applications.
 FUTURE SCOPE AND SCALABILITY:
This application can be  further extended to other states, and ultimately to the entire country.
The symptom based booking system can be used in hospitals for everyone, as it will facilitate faster specified treatments, keeps an e-record of the patients and preventing against medical frauds.
We also plan to add a road safety alert system  in the future, this system will send alerts to the users when they are in accident prone zones(To mark a region as an accident prone zone we will use traffic data, user data, and road condition).
